# K12ReportGenerator
These are the code files I use to automatically generate reports of my students progress in their K12 courses. I also send the generated document to others who assist the students. 

Info:
grade_warnings.js - JavaScript file which implements the color change to the cells if the cells indicate a failing grade, or a low amount of progress.
progress_assembly.jl - Julia file which assembles the reports. Pretty quick and easy to use (to me)

Sample - contains sample outputs
